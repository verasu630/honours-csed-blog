# Introduction

Welcome to the first Music Computing Workshop! Today, we will focus on familiarising you with the BBC Microbit and some of its features.

Feel free to discuss your thoughts with your peers at any point, or even speak up if you have questions! This is your chance to 

# Task 1 - Different Parts of the Microbit

Take a look at this photo of the Microbit. There are several different pieces. 2 buttons, an accelerometer, microphone, speaker and an LED screen. There's also the slots for battery, a USB port and a reset button. Look at the labeled images below and try and find each of these features.

# Task 2 - Hello World!

Let's get started with coding straight away! The first step of any programmer's journey is displaying Hello World on the screen, but let's switch it up a bit!

On your screen, you should have two *functions*, beep and boop. When the program *calls* a function, the function will do something (that something depends on whoever made the function), beep and boop will each play a different note. We also have a block called "on start". This means whenever the Microbit starts, it will do whatever you've put inside it.

So let's start by dragging beep and boop into the "on start" block. You can see if it works by clicking the start button and asking MakeCode to "play your code".

Time to experiment a little bit: Try to make the Microbit sing beep boop three times!

# Task 3 - Deeper into Beep Boop

Next let's look deeper into how beep boop works. You should see two "function" blocks on your screen called beep and boop. Beep plays Middle E for 1 beat and boop plays Middle D for 1 beat. We only told each function to do one thing, but we can tell it to do many things. Just like how we told "on start" to do 6 things (beep, boop, beep, boop, beep boop). There's no reason it has to be two different functions, so let's combine them into one function called beepBoop and then make Microbit sing beep boop three times using beepBoop instead of our two functions.

Experimentation time: Let's try to display a heart icon on the screen while beep boop is playing. Can you find the right instruction?

Extension time: Now that you're feeling confident, try making the Microbit sing a short tune. There's no right or wrong answer so do what makes you feel comfortable!

## Random notes and thoughts

- Should I convert each task to be livecoding -> the students try?
- Introduce play note then functions rather than current order?
