As part of my project into improving interest and self-efficacy of non-standard demographics in computing, it will be important to use proven evaluations methods to quantify these main measures. Therefore, this week the focus of my research has been on how other researchers may have framed these types of questions in their own studies, and how they then quantified their measures for comparison. This would allow me to design a pre- and post-program survey using these targeted questions, and compare for any statistically significant changes before and after the program. Of course, the aim is to see an increase in both measures.


## Self-efficacy

Bandura has defined self-efficacy as "people's judgements of their capability to organise and execute course of action required to attain designated types of performance". This can be modified through performance accomplishments, vicarious or observed learning, emotions arousal (in the form of anxiety) as a form of negative feedback, and verbal encouragement. This then influences the indiviuals choice of whether to continue a task, level of effort when completing the task, persistant when faced with difficulites, and overall task performance.

Using this model of self-efficacy, it has been found that self-efficacy is a significant factor in the retention of women in computer science and there are significant gaps between genders when it comes to confidence in their abilities. This leads to the higher drop out rate in women. Although my research is not focused on any specific demographic or minority group, it is clear that part of improving diversity in computing would be through improving an individual's self-efficacy.

One particular study of note was conducted by Compeau and Higgins in 1995, where they developed a quesionnaire to measure self-efficacy which was then used to measure how certain factors influenced self-efficacy. The question asked if students would be able to complete some job given an unfamiliar software package under a variety of conditions, and to rate their confidence if they felt they could complete this job. I think this language might be inaccessible for high school students with little experience in computing, especially if used as a pre-program survey. However, the language could easily be adapted into something more relevant to the workshops (eg. can you complete a job if given a new language?).

Another study from Quante in 2003 used a series of 21 questions separated into 6 main factors as the measure for self efficacy. These factors are problem solving confidence, computer troubleshooting confidence, career encouragement, satisfaction with college major, career exploration and course anxiety. They then compared the mean factor score of different groups (eg. success/no-success grade, m/f, m/f success grade etc) and found that men had more confidence in their troubleshoot capability in comparison to women, though did not delve into how these differences emerged (eg. where they obtained these skills or why they simply have more confidence). I think the questions developed from this system is more closely aligned with the goals of my research and is another option I will consider.

## Interest

In terms of interest (or sometimes attitutde), I found an interesting paper regarding measuring interest/attitude towards computing directed at middle-school students. Similar to the two measures for self-efficacy, this is designed as a short, self-report instrument to gain insight on the results of educational interventions and measure its success. Middle school was targetted in particular as studies have shown it is a critical age for engaging students in computer science, especially for marginalised groups or women. This is the same demographic as the target of my research.

This system uses a 5-point measure on a set of 10 statements which aims to capture the student's overall attitude into computing (rather than specific sub-disciplines or subjects in computing like many previous systems). Some examples of these statments are "I would like to create new computer programs" or "I am interested in what makes computers work". These seem to be braodly relevant to the goals of my research. However, I would still consider making some modifications to this scale to be more suited to a creative or music computing context. For example, "When I combine math and science, I can invent more useful computer programs" seems less relevant to my goals, so I may consider omitting some of these items from the final measurment survey.

One intersting (but unrelated) note was the two different approaches to designing content for CS0 classes. In a future blog post, I would like to explore in the future would be the difference between a breadth-first or depth-first approach when working with novices to computing and whether it has an impact on future interest or self-efficacy.
